# GraphQL federation: Mercurius + Apollo

This is a playground repro to explore [Apollo Gateway](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/using-federation/api/apollo-gateway/), [Apollo Router](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/) and [Mercurius](https://mercurius.dev/) reciprocal integrations.

## Abstract

This repo is an investigation carried on for this [discovery issue](https://github.com/nearform/bench-draft-issues/issues/167). All setups provided in this repo work as expected at the time being (January 2023) âœ….

Each setup exposes:

- 2 sub graphs servers at: `http://localhost:4001/graphql` and `http://localhost:4002/graphql`
- 1 federated server at: `http://localhost:4000/graphql`

## Requirements

- Node LTS

## Setup

- `npm ci`

## Available setups

### âœ… 00 - Mercurius gateway + Mercurius sub graphs [ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ“‚](./src/00-mercurius-gateway-with-mercurius-services)

All infra managed by Mercurius.

### âœ… 01 - Apollo gateway + Mercurius sub graphs with runtime introspection [ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ“‚](./src/01-apollo-gateway-with-mercurius-services)

Sub graphs running on Mercurius federated by Apollo Gateway with [runtime introspection](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/using-federation/apollo-gateway-setup#composing-subgraphs-with-introspectandcompose) (no static supergraph needed).

### âœ… 02 - Apollo gateway + Mercurius sub graphs with supergraph [ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ“‚](./src/02-apollo-gateway-with-mercurius-services-and-supergraph)

Federate Mercurius sub graphs with Apollo gateway using a [pre-generated supergraph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/using-federation/apollo-gateway-setup#composing-the-supergraph-schema).

The supergraph is created with [`@apollo/rover`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/) by:

- Running locally mercurius sub graphs (`01-apollo-gateway-with-mercurius-services`)
- Run `@apollo/rover` against them (`rover` if configured with `src/services/rover-config.yaml`) with `npm run generate:supergraph`

### âœ… 03 - Apollo router + Mercurius sub graphs [ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ“‚](./src/03-apollo-router-with-mercurius-services)

Federate Mercurius sub graphs with [Apollo router](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/) using a pre-generated supergraph.

Mercurius seems to [be officially supported](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/building-supergraphs/supported-subgraphs/#javascript--typescript).

Apollo router is currently installed locally brutally (`npm run install:apollo-router`): we might consider dokerize it :)

### âœ… 04 - Apollo gateway with Apollo sub graphs [ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ“‚](./src/04-apollo-gateway-with-apollo-services)

All infra managed by Apollo (just for the sake of completeness)

### âœ… 05 - Mercurius gateway with Apollo sub graphs [ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ“‚](./src/05-mercurius-gateway-with-apollo-services)

Federate Apollo sub graphs with a Mercurius gateway.

## Extra info

Debug GQL request:

```
curl --request POST \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --url http://localhost:4000/ \
  --data '{"query":"query { me { posts { title } } }"}'
```

## Benchmark

See dedicated [benchmarks docs](./docs/BENCHMARK.md/).

Check a complete report [benchmarks report docs](./docs/REPORTS.md/).

## Todo

- Extend sub graph schemas to represent more complex entities
- Increase the number of running sub graph services
- Review benchmarks and re-run them with real-world data
- Automated tests
